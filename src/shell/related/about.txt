The core idea of the ADx is to investigate the possibility of comparison of methods for adaptation decision-making, and the central argument is that applying multiple methods to a given set of adaptation options and comparing their outputs may provide a more robust assessment.
The ADx concept therefore aims to:
support improved understanding of - and communication about - the conditions of applicability of different adaptation decision-making methods
provide guidance on - and a tool for - selecting from a wide range of decision-making methods 
provide implementations of decision-making methods that could be used in adaptation: those which are based on integration with the best available climate information, and which best suit the needs of adaption researchers, analysts and practitioners
facilitate comparison of the outputs of several decision methods applied to a given set of adaptation options, strategies or measures
